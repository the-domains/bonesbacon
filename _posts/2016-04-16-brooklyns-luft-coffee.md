  About five years ago, Blair Smith's twice-a-day coffee pitstop at NYC's Kaffe
  1668 led to him striking up a friendship with barista Justin Rodriguez behind
  the counter. Smith then met mobile developer Aaron Sutula in a coffee seminar
  held by an espresso machine company. "I took a day off of work to go,"
  remembers Sutula.
